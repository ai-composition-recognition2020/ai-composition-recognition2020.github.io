### Requirements files

According to the requirements.txt

### Data

The music in the fake file is generated by AI, the music in the real file is generated by human.

`data/dev/fake/` is the development dataset file.

`data/eval/` is used to evaluate the system performance. The participants can use the external
human-music if they want to evaluate their systems.

`data/test` is the evaluation dataset file

Notice：All the data in the baseline is just used to show the process of the code,
which is different from the data of the challenge.

### Run

```python
# train
python ./train.py
# eval
python ./test.py --model_path ./model.pth --eval
# test (The output csv file will be generated after running test)
python ./test.py --model_path ./model.pth
```

### Results

The structure of the output csv file：

| file_name | score    |
| --------- | ----- |
| test-008  | 0.8   |
| test-009  | 0.6   |
| test-010  | 0.5   |
